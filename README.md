# MetaScope

MetaScope is a genome browser with integrative functions, highly flexible and interactive user interface, by which molecular biologists with minimal computational skills can visualizae their genome-scale datasets along with canonicalgenomic annotations, and analyze, curate and integrate with data operation functions of MetaScope. The datasets MetaScope can handle include tiling array data (ChIP-chip and expression profiling), calcualted peak data, transcription start site data, and genomic annotation in GFF format.



Use MetaScope in order to

- Visualize datasets including ChIP-chip data, expression profiling data and transcription start site data

- Analyze, validate, curate and integrate datasets by cross-referencing multiple -omic data

- Build and share genome annotations

- Analyze and compare multiple -omics data from two or more species
